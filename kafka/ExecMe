In case that Docker-compose do not create the Broker correctly, you should execute these steps:

If you don't have the plugging of docker on Intellj to work with the containers throw the IDE,
must go to your docker desktop, go to the container Kafka > Broker > and go the the "Exec" window to execute the next
commands:

 1-   kafka-topics --create --topic SHIPS --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1

 2-   kafka-topics --describe --topic SHIPS --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

 3-   kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic SHIPS --from-beginning


 The first one is for create the Topic that we need to retrieve the message pushed.

 The second one is for check if we have correctly the topic create

 The last One is for consult the message that we consume. Need push it before to exec this one.

 For push a message, you need create a new ship.
